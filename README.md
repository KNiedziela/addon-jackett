## About

You can use this add-on to install Jackett, which is an open-source indexer scraper. Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, Lidarr, DuckieTV, qBittorrent, Nefarious etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries. For more information, please see [Jackett].

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is straightforward and easy to do.

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Hass.io** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Add the Hass.io add-on repository https://github.com/Sabuto/hassio-repo/.
3. Install the "Jackett" add-on.

## How to use

To get the add-on running:

1. Start the add-on.
2. Have some patience and wait a couple of minutes.
3. Check the add-on log output to see the result.


## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration, with all available options:

```json
{
    "black_hole": "/share/blackhole"
}
```

**Note**: _This should only be changed if you need the torrent files to be saved in a different location._

### Option: `black_hole`

The `black_hole` option controls the location of saved torrent files. It can be set to share, config or ssl folders.
